# 🩺 MedImage Enhancer 🔍  

A beginner-friendly yet advanced **Python project** that enhances **medical images** (such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans) using modern **image processing techniques**.  

This tool is designed to help demonstrate how **Computer Vision and AI** concepts can be applied to **medical imaging** — a core area in **Medical Physics, Radiology, and Biomedical Engineering**.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  

Medical images often suffer from **noise, low contrast, or unclear structures**, which makes diagnosis more difficult.  
The **MedImage Enhancer** applies classical image processing methods to improve visibility and highlight important features.  

This project is especially suitable for:  
- 🎓 Students exploring **Medical Physics & Healthcare AI**  
- 🧑‍💻 Beginners in **Python & OpenCV**  
- ⚡ Researchers who want a **base for medical image preprocessing**  

---

## ✨ Features(Basic)  

✅ Upload medical images (PNG, JPG, JPEG)  
✅ Noise Removal (Gaussian Blur)  
✅ Contrast Enhancement (Histogram Equalization)  
✅ Edge Detection (Canny Algorithm)  
✅ Side-by-side **Before vs. After visualization**  
✅ Simple, interactive **Streamlit web app**
